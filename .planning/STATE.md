# STATE

## Project Reference

- **Project:** Picoclaw Multi-Tenant OSS Runtime
- **Core value:** Teams can run Picoclaw safely for many users with strong isolation and predictable behavior, without building orchestration and sandbox infrastructure.
- **Current milestone scope:** v1 OSS self-hosted runtime foundation.
- **Roadmap depth:** standard
- **Current focus:** Phase 1 - Identity and Policy Baseline

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 1 of 5 (Identity and Policy Baseline)
- **Plan status:** 01-02 Complete
- **Execution status:** In Progress
- **Progress bar:** [██--------] 20%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| ID | Date | Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|----|------|------|----------|-----------|
| ORIG-001 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Phase structure derived from v1 requirement clusters and dependency order | Natural grouping of related features |
| ORIG-002 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | User-centric tenancy is preserved as a first-class invariant | Core product value |
| ORIG-003 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Checkpoint durability and immutable audit history are core runtime behavior | Compliance and observability requirements |
| ORIG-004 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Agent workflow invariant: `define templates -> create agent pack -> infrastructure handles scale` | Simplified UX |
| ORIG-005 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Agent pack portability is first-class in v1 | Run anywhere philosophy |
| ORIG-006 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Guest-mode requests use random ephemeral identities and skip persistence | Privacy and simplicity |
| D-01-01-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Use lazy initialization for SQLAlchemy engine and session factory | Allow Alembic import without database connection |
| D-01-01-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Use UUID primary keys for all identity tables | Distributed system compatibility and security |
| D-01-01-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Apply both ENABLE and FORCE ROW Level Security on tenant tables | Ensure consistent tenant isolation, prevent owner bypass |
| D-01-01-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Create placeholder RLS policies with 'true' condition in initial migration | Framework in place, policies refined in later phases |
| D-01-02-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Use secrets.token_urlsafe for cryptographically secure key generation | Python's secrets module provides highest quality randomness |
| D-01-02-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Use SHA-256 hashing with hmac.compare_digest for timing-safe validation | Prevents timing attacks by ensuring constant-time comparison |
| D-01-02-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Store only key hashes in database, never plaintext keys | Security best practice - prevents key extraction if DB compromised |
| D-01-02-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Support both X-Api-Key header and Authorization: Bearer token formats | Flexibility for different client implementations and API conventions |
| D-01-02-005 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Key rotation preserves key ID but changes material | Allows tracking key lineage while ensuring security |
| D-01-02-006 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Key revocation sets is_active=False rather than deleting records | Preserves audit trail and allows recovery if needed |

### TODOs

- [x] Create executable plan for Phase 1.
- [x] Execute Plan 01-01: Bootstrap identity foundation
- [x] Execute Plan 01-02: Authentication endpoints
- [ ] Execute Plan 01-03: Tenant isolation middleware
- [ ] Confirm phase-level acceptance tests before implementation starts.
- [ ] Track requirement status transitions from Pending -> In Progress -> Done during execution.

### Blockers

- None currently.

## Session Continuity
