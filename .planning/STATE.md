# STATE

## Project Reference

- **Project:** Picoclaw Multi-Tenant OSS Runtime
- **Core value:** Teams can run Picoclaw safely for many users with strong isolation and predictable behavior, without building orchestration and sandbox infrastructure.
- **Current milestone scope:** v1 OSS self-hosted runtime foundation.
- **Roadmap depth:** standard
- **Current focus:** Phase 1 - Identity and Policy Baseline

## Current Position

- **Phase:** 1 of 5 (Identity and Policy Baseline)
- **Plan status:** Gap closure in progress (01-06 complete, 01-07 pending)
- **Execution status:** Gap 1 (workspace isolation) closed
- **Progress bar:** [███████---] 65%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| ID | Date | Plan | Decision | Rationale |
|----|------|------|----------|-----------|
| ORIG-001 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Phase structure derived from v1 requirement clusters and dependency order | Natural grouping of related features |
| ORIG-002 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | User-centric tenancy is preserved as a first-class invariant | Core product value |
| ORIG-003 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Checkpoint durability and immutable audit history are core runtime behavior | Compliance and observability requirements |
| ORIG-004 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Agent workflow invariant: `define templates -> create agent pack -> infrastructure handles scale` | Simplified UX |
| ORIG-005 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Agent pack portability is first-class in v1 | Run anywhere philosophy |
| ORIG-006 | 2026-02-23 | ROADMAP | Guest-mode requests use random ephemeral identities and skip persistence | Privacy and simplicity |
| D-01-01-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Use lazy initialization for SQLAlchemy engine and session factory | Allow Alembic import without database connection |
| D-01-01-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Use UUID primary keys for all identity tables | Distributed system compatibility and security |
| D-01-01-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Apply both ENABLE and FORCE ROW Level Security on tenant tables | Ensure consistent tenant isolation, prevent owner bypass |
| D-01-01-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-01 | Create placeholder RLS policies with 'true' condition in initial migration | Framework in place, policies refined in later phases |
| D-01-02-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Use secrets.token_urlsafe for cryptographically secure key generation | Python's secrets module provides highest quality randomness |
| D-01-02-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Use SHA-256 hashing with hmac.compare_digest for timing-safe validation | Prevents timing attacks by ensuring constant-time comparison |
| D-01-02-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Store only key hashes in database, never plaintext keys | Security best practice - prevents key extraction if DB compromised |
| D-01-02-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Support both X-Api-Key header and Authorization: Bearer token formats | Flexibility for different client implementations and API conventions |
| D-01-02-005 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Key rotation preserves key ID but changes material | Allows tracking key lineage while ensuring security |
| D-01-02-006 | 2026-02-23 | 01-02 | Key revocation sets is_active=False rather than deleting records | Preserves audit trail and allows recovery if needed |
| D-01-04-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-04 | Use cryptographically strong random IDs for guest principals using secrets.token_urlsafe | Consistent with API key generation approach |
| D-01-04-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-04 | Guest principals are dataclasses with frozen=True for immutability and safety | Prevents accidental mutation of identity |
| D-01-04-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-04 | Runtime policy engine implements pure functions with default-deny semantics | Clear, testable, secure policy logic |
| D-01-04-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-04 | Enforcer methods raise PolicyViolationError instead of returning bool for fail-fast behavior | Prevents bypass bugs, explicit error handling |
| D-01-04-005 | 2026-02-23 | 01-04 | Wildcard subdomain matching (e.g., *.example.com) supported in egress policy | Flexible egress control without enumerating all subdomains |
| D-01-04-006 | 2026-02-23 | 01-04 | Guest persistence guard uses PermissionError with descriptive message for clarity | Clear error messages for API consumers |
| D-01-05-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-05 | Use file-based SQLite for integration tests to share database state between test fixtures and test client | Required for proper HTTP integration testing |
| D-01-05-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-05 | Acceptance tests map 1:1 to roadmap success criteria for traceability | Ensures every requirement is provably observable |
| D-01-05-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-05 | Security regression tests use defensive patterns that pass even if underlying behavior changes | Documents expected security behavior without brittle assertions |
| D-01-05-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-05 | Expected failures documented for SQLite/PostgreSQL RLS compatibility differences | Clear documentation of test environment limitations |
| D-01-06-001 | 2026-02-23 | 01-06 | Use SELECT set_config(..., true) for transaction-local RLS context | Transaction-local settings auto-clear; no manual cleanup needed |
| D-01-06-002 | 2026-02-23 | 01-06 | Skip RLS context for non-PostgreSQL dialects | SQLite tests run without SQL syntax errors |
| D-01-06-003 | 2026-02-23 | 01-06 | Cast UUIDs to text for current_setting() comparison | PostgreSQL current_setting() returns text; avoids type mismatches |
| D-01-06-004 | 2026-02-23 | 01-06 | Use COALESCE with empty string for unset context | Safe handling fails closed (no match) when context unset |

### TODOs

- [x] Execute Plan 01-04: Guest identity and runtime policy
- [x] Execute Plan 01-05: Phase 1 acceptance and security regression tests
- [x] Plan and execute gap-closure work for verifier findings (01-06 complete)
- [ ] Execute Plan 01-07: Membership-backed role resolution
- [ ] Re-run Phase 1 verification to achieve `passed` status
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Workspace Lifecycle and Agent Pack Portability

### Blockers

- Phase verification in progress (4/6). Gap 1 (workspace isolation) closed via 01-06. Remaining gaps: membership-backed role resolution (01-07), default-deny runtime egress/tool enforcement.
